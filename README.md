# goofy-coin
An extremely simple centralized crypto coin based on the goofy coin system, as proposed in the book [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu).

Notes
=====
This package contains the goofycoin daemon only. The test file could be used as a guide to writing a client.

Warning
=======
This software has not been extensively tested and should not EVER be used for any financial purpose. I'm sure bugs exist. This is for learning purposes only!

ToDo
====
* Document differences from GoofyCoin as presented in the book
* Document the API
* Maybe stop using the NIST p-256 curve
